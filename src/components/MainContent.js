                    Have a good catching start so that your reader wants to continue

                <p>
                    write short enough and clear sentences. Do not overcomplicate things!

                <p>
                    Third topic must be more exiting so that people want to continue this far

                <p>
                    If your reader has already managed to reach this far, it is quite likely 
                    that they will finish the rest of the text too. Keep up good work!

                    It's a good idea to finish with something that ties together everything
                    that was said in the previous section.
